LiveMix is an video switching program I'm developing as a companion to DViz.

It's designed for time-critical performance, especially with regards to live video feeds from capture cards. I'm working hard to reduce the latency from the card to the screen to as low as possible. 

= Features =

* MDI UI
* OpenGL rendering
* Low-latency live video feeds
* Integration with DViz as a video source or for overlays (TBD)

= Appeal for Feedback =

LiveMix is under heavy, active development now - features and code subject to change at a moments notice.
