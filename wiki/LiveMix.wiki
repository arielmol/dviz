LiveMix is an video switching program being developed as a companion to DViz.

It's designed for time-critical performance, especially with regards to live video feeds from capture cards. Reducing latency from the card to the screen is a key design goal in this program.

(Yes, in the screenshot, the viewers in LiveMix are running at <= 15fps - they are intentionally rate-limited to reduce the performance burden placed on the GUI/CPU by the control window. The full-screen output window, however, runs with no upper bound on FPS.)

= Features =

  * MDI UI
  * OpenGL rendering
  * Low-latency live video feeds
  * Integration with DViz as a video source or for overlays (TBD)

= Appeal for Feedback =

LiveMix is under heavy, active development now - features and code subject to change at a moments notice.
