= Quick Start =

  # Download and Install DViz
    Since DViz hasn't been officially "released" yet, you can download the source to DViz from [http://code.google.com/p/dviz/source/checkout the Google Code Source repository]. You'll need [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads Qt] to compile DViz. For more information on building DViz, see [CompilingDVizFromSource].
  # Open DViz 
  # Setup your "Live" output
    * Outputs are setup from the File menu under "Program Settings." Select "Configure Outputs" from the first tab.
    * DViz supports virtually unlimited number of outputs, and comes setup for three outputs to start with. 
    * Your "Live" output is generally considered your "Primary" or main output, but thats just convention - no technical limitation. 
    * The only "special" output is the "Foldback" output. This output automatically has a text-only filter turned on, and when viewing songs, it has a special "Song Text Filter" that gets enabled. Both of those filters can be disabled if you choose, but they are automatically turned on by default.
    * For more information on Outputs, see [GuideToOutputs].
  # Quick Fulfillment: 
    * To show a song on the live output, select the "Songs" tab from the "Items" dock on the left
    * Double-click on a song to add it to the schedule list
    * The song will automatically display the first passage on the live output if no other content is live on the output.
    * If something else was already live on the output, just double-click on the song in the schedule to send it to the live output.
    * To change slides in the song, just click the passage of text in the Slide List. Song passages are separated by dotted lines, while other slide group's slides are displayed in a grid with a larger snapshot of the slide. 
    * For more on changing slides and using the Output Control, see [GuideToOutputControl].
